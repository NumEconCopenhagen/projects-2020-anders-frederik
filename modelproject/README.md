# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **A Cournot competition model with product differentiation**.
We model a simple Cournot competition model with product differentiation and find the equilibrium quantities, price and profit via numerical optimization.
We vizualize the results by parametrizations in three different ways:
1. Parametrizations.
2. Plot the best response functions in quantity-space.
3. Plot the equilibrium values as a function of a parameter (degree of substitutability)

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [model_project.ipynb](model_project_v2.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
