Isolating the profit maximizing quantity $x_i^*$ yields the best response function, $x_i^*=R_{x_i}(x_j^*)$. In order to define this function, we use scipy brute force where the optimization problem per default is a minimization problem. Thus, if we want to maximize the profit of firm i, $\\pi_i(x_i,x_j)$, we need to minimize $-\\pi_i(x_i,x_j)$. The method evaluates $-\\pi_i(x_i,x_j)$ for each value of $x_i$ in the given range in order to find the global minimum. "
