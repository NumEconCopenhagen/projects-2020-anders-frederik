This assignment aims to solve a representative consumers utility maximization problem by using numerical analysis. More precisely, we use python-language in order to determine the optimal levels of consumption and labor supply given a specific utility function, multiple conditions and predetermined parameter values. Afterwards we calculate the subsequent taxrevenue and which level of different taxes that maximizes this revenue.
