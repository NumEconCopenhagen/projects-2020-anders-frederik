**The future Corona cases in Denmark**       
We first give an overview of the sitaution in Denmark; graphing the Corona cases, deaths, recovered, death rate and recovered rate then, we model we use a simple exponential growth model to extrapolate the future Corona cases in Denmark.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades the datasets**: **covid_19_data.csv**
