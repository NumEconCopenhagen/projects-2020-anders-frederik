# Inaugural project

This assignment aims to solve a representative consumers utility maximization problem by using numerical analysis. More precisely, we use python-language in order to determine the optimal levels of consumption and labor supply given a specific utility function, multiple conditions and predetermined parameter values. Afterwards we calculate the subsequent taxrevenue and which level of different taxes that maximizes this revenue.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
